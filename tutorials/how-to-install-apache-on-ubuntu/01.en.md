## Introduction

Apache is a free and open-source Web Server widely use around the world,
the First version released in 1995,
Apache is cross-platform which means can run on any OS,
Installing and Using Apache is pretty straightforward
So let's begin

**Prerequisites**

If there are any prerequisites for your tutorial, please write them out here.
If there is already a tutorial explaining one of the prerequisites, make sure to link to that other tutorial.

For example:

* a VPS or Dedicated Server with minimum 1G of ram and 1 Core CPU
* fresh installed Ubuntu (preferably 18.04 or 20.04 or 22.04)

**Example terminology**


* Server IP: 172.16.144.132
* Username : matt

    Replace `<172.16.144.132>` and `<matt>` with your actual IP and root Username

## Step 1 - Updating Package Manager

update the apt package manager repos

```bash
sudo apt update
```

This command will update the package index files on the system. 

## Step 2 - Installing Apache

## Step 4 - replacing Default apache template with actual script

Now we need to replace our own files with default web server page

First head over to /var/www/html

cd /var/www/html
```

then modify index.html file

```bash
sudo nano index.html
```
> you can also put your script instead of modifing index.html file
